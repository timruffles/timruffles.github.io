  I'm an engineer at poolside.ai, previously at Plaid, GitHub and Cloudflare.

  I [speak](/speaking) at user-groups and conferences.

  I was a [Google Developer Expert](https://web.archive.org/web/20170715082055/https://developers.google.com/experts/people/tim-ruffles) for the web platform between 2014-2020. I also [trained developers](/developer-training) for organisations like The FT, White October Events (Angular Conf, Render etc), Gilt.com and the European Bioinformatics Institute.
