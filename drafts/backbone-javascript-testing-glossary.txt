template: "erb"
definitions:
  assertion: "Boolean (yes/no) function that causes the [test] it's executed within to fail if it is not true."
  behaviour: "What your code should do. For instance, a <pre>sqrt</pre> function should give you <pre>sqrt(4) == 2</pre> and <pre>sqrt(2) == NaN</pre>. This is contrasted with <em>how</em> it does it - this is [implementation]. See [implementation] for a worked example."
  implementation: "How your code does something. For instance, you could remove an element with <pre>$(el).remove()</pre> or <pre>el.parentNode.innerHTML = ''</pre> or <pre>el.parentNode.removeChild(el)</pre> If you write a test that tests for removal by ensuring any one of these methods was called, it'll break if you later change to another method, even if the [behaviour] - the removal - is actually still occurring. Test for the removal - you only care that it's done, not how."
  declarative: "Not a testing term, but a programming pattern that ensures you write code to do routine jobs, eliminating the need to write certain tests. For instance - HTML lets you 'declare' you'd like a red box with a 1px border and 3px drop shadow. In Canvas, you'd have to draw the 4 edges etc. You'd not need to test the HTML render, but you would the canvas. Similarly, you can setup a event listener by hand, or use Backbone's declarative event binding hash."
  example:
    text: "An example of behaviour something should exhibit."
    also: test
  BDD: "Behaviour driven development - a style of testing that emphasises that you should be testing [behaviour not implementation](/javascript-testing-concepts#behaviour-not-implementation). Often uses testing syntax that approximates natural language."
  "functional test": "Tests that run on functionality users could recognise, as close to the production environment as possible. Contrast with [unit test]"
  helper: "In testing, normally handles a bit of repetitive test setup."
  mock: "An implementation of a method that also acts as an [assertion] about how that method is called during the [test]. For example, it could be set to fail if it is called too often or seldom, or with the wrong arguments."
  "none-one-many": "You can have none, one or many things, both in the sense of being passed a null, object or collection. Make sure code can handle all three, or at least mentally ensure you've know why it won't see one or more of them."
  stub: "Replacement for real implementation of a method. An example would be: <code>model.slowMethod = function() { return 'result that otherwise would take ages to generate' };</code>"
  spec:
    text: "Short for 'specification'."
    also: test
  "integration test": "Tests to ensure multiple components work - integrate - with each other. Often a synonym for [integration test]."
  test: "Code containing one or more [assertion] that ensures the code under test has the behaviour described it in the test's name."
  "test suite": "One or more [tests], run together."
  "test case": "A [test]"
  TDD: "Test-Driven-Development - writing code only when you have a failing test. Writing tests first makes you 'drive-out' your development by making each test pass."
  "unit test": "A test of an isolated function or small piece of behaviour. Likely involves using [stubs](#stub) to avoid relying on complex, slow or not-yet-implemented code."
