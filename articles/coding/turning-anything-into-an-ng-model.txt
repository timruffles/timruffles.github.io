title: "Turn anything into an ng-model with ngModelController"

  Few people realise that `ng-model` can be turn any interactive component into a fully-working input for use in Angular's `form` system. This saves you a heap of time in reinventing wheels - very often I see 100s of lines of codes in controllers managing state that Angular's `ng-model` desperately wants to manage for you.

  To demo this we'll plug a non-Angular SVG clock into `ng-model`.

  Try dragging the sun, editing the input and hitting 'start'. As you can see, we'll achieve full ng-model functionality with a very unusual input.

  ## Turning a widget into an input

  First off - here's our template. A standard Angular form, with two-way binding between our input and the value of `input.time` via `ng-model`:
  

      <form name=timeForm>

        <svg width=1000 height=1000>

          <!-- here we bind our clock to item.time -->
          <g clock-input 
             ng-model=item.time 
             name=time>
          </g>

          <!-- view the value of our input  -->
          <text x=500 y=500>
            {{ item.time | date:"shortTime" }}
          </text>
          <text x=500 y=550 ng-click="toggle()">
            {{ ticking ? "Stop" : "Start" }}
          </text>

        </svg>

      </form>

  To get this template working we'll next need to:

  1. create the `clock-input` directive that initialises our clock widget
  1. access the controller of the `ng-model` within our directive
  1. implement two-way binding with our widget via the controller's API

  ## Step 1

  We've got a `donutClock()` widget to instantiate, so let's write a wrapper directive:

      module.directive("clock-input", function clock() {
        return {
          link: function(scope, el, attrs) {

            // initialize the non-angular widget
            var clock = donutClock({
              onInput: view2model,
              el: el[0],
            });

            function view2model() {
              // placeholder
            }

          }
        }
      });

  As you can see - the code in `donutClock` is going to remain ignorant of `ng-model`, meaning it's in no way coupled to Angular.


  ## Step 2

  To get at the controller instance for our `ng-model`, we request it in our directive definition via the `require:` key. Without a prefix, it'll ensure an instance of the `ng-model` directive is present on the same element as our `clock-input`, and pass the `ng-model`'s controller to our linking function.

      module.directive("clock-input", function clock() {
        return {
          require: "ngModel",
          /* ngModel instance passed as forth param to link */
          link: function(scope, el, attrs, ngModel) {
          // ...

  In this post we'll only be using `require` with `ngModel`, but I recommend reading the docs and thinking about how your own directive controllers could help clean up your code.

  ## Step 3

  We're now going to implement two way binding in our `link` function: getting view values into the model, and getting updated model values into the view.

  `ngModelController` is the important API here. It's the abstract representation of an input's logical state, with various APIs for you to hook into the 2-way binding process.

  We inform the controller of updated time values from the widget via `ngModel.$setViewValue(newValue)`. This'll update the model after it's been parsed and validated, and update the form object's state variables (e.g `timeForm.time.$pristine)`.

  To control how updates from the model side are presented by the view we override `ngModel.$render()`, which is called when a change is detected to the model:

      link: function(scope, el, attrs, ngModel) {

        // initialize the non-angular widget, and
        // pass in our model updating function
        var clock = donutClock({
          onInput: view2model,
          el: el[0],
        });

        function view2model(value) {
          ngModel.$setViewValue(value);
        }

        // when angular detects a change to the model,
        // we update our widget
        ngModel.$render = function model2view() {
          clock.set(ngModel.$viewValue);
        }

      }

  That's it.

  You can do lots more with `ngModelController` - adding validators to the `$validators` object, changing how the values are parsed from the view, or formatted for it, with the `$parsers` and `$formatters` arrays - but that's a story for another blog post.

  ## Three cheers

  I really like this API! One API to turn anything - D3 visualisations, React components, random non-Angular widgets, `<canvas>`, the audio input or accelerometer - into an ng-model. A great example of a well designed abstraction promoting reuse.

  ## Summary

  - wrap components that capture user interactive with a directive and `require` `ngModel`
  - use the `ngModelController` APIs to control how your widget updates the model, and renders updates to its value
  - via `ngModelController` you can also control formatting of values to display in the widget, and the parsing and validation of values read from it
  - if you see a heap of `$watch`es in your controller handling the state of user input, think: is there a `ng-model` missing somewhere?
