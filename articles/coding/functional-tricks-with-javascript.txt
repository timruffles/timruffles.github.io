  Learning a few big ideas from functional programming made a dramatic difference to the way I wrote code. A few years back I gave a talk to London Web Standards to share my experiences with an audiences of JS developers. I just noticed the [recording](https://vimeo.com/79386248) is on Vimeo!

  If you're already an FP expert there's nothing new here. But if you're still learning, or a bit rusty, you might find it useful! [Slides here](http://timruffles.github.io/functional-tricks/). I cover:

  - the power of `call`, `apply`, `bind` and closures in Javascript
  - `map`, `reduce`, `filter` to clean up loops 
  - writing your own higher order functions
