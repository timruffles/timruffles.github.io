  <p>I’m writing a <a href="https://github.com/timruffles/js-to-c" >JavaScript to C compiler</a>, and I&#39;d like to share the journey. Why? Figuring out how things ‘really work’ is a deep itch for me. I’m a self-taught developer. Throughout my infatuation with coding I’ve been slowly digging deeper and deeper into the magic of how our code actually runs. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/timruffles1/coffeescript-essence" >Way back</a> in 2011 I started hacking around with the Coffeescript transpiler, for example seeing what it took to add Ruby’s overridable comparison operator to the language:</p>

<p>I ran a <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/sicp-blitz-london/" >meet up group</a> that made a speedy journey through SICP. The final two chapters of that book always felt like they required a lot more time than was easy to give them. So earlier this year I took a week out to stay in a beautiful house in the Austrian alps with SICP, pen and paper, and a goal: read chapters four and five of SICP and do the exercises!</p>

<p>After that week I felt I’d cracked the book, and had got a good idea of how compilers can be implemented. However, the challenge set by <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms" >SICP’s</a> <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-35.html#%_thm_5.52" >final exercise</a> wouldn&#39;t get out of my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a counterpoint to exercise 5.51, modify the compiler so that it compiles Scheme procedures into sequences of C instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This exercises exemplifies why I love SICP - it&#39;s a mentor that shows sets you genuinely challenging tasks, which you can rely on giving you insights you&#39;ll find useful for as long as you write code.</p>
<p>Lots of people have completed this exercise for Scheme, which requires you to change the target language for the book&#39;s compiler from the book&#39;s own register machine to C. Instead, I was interested to see how it’d work out for Javascript, which&#39;d require writing a compiler from scratch.</p>
<p>I’ve got a lot out of the process so far, and I want to share it. To say the least it’s way too much for a single post.  So I’m going to blog it every two weeks, going retrospectively over the first steps. I’ll introduce parsing and compiling bit by bit, without any required computer-science or C background: just the way I learned it!</p>
<p>I’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling an interpreted, dynamic language. HUH?</li>
<li>Compiler basics</li>
<li>Representing values at runtime</li>
<li>Compiling statements</li>
<li>Compiling operators</li>
<li>Compiling functions</li>
<li>Compiling exceptions</li>
<li>Garbage collection</li>
<li>Event driven runtime</li>
</ul>
